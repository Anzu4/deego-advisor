# Deego Advisor

## Install (from a release zip)
1) Download the latest `deego-advisor.zip` from the GitHub Releases page.
2) Unzip it into your WoW AddOns folder so you get:
   `.../World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/deego-advisor/`
3) Restart WoW or `/reload`.

If the folder path is correct, you should see `deego-advisor.toc` inside the `deego-advisor` folder.

## Usage
- Open the UI with `/deego`.
